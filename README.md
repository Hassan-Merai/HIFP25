# HIFP25 - Health Insurance Fraud Project 2025
This project was developed by [Jan0341](https://github.com/Jan0341) and [Hassan-Merai](https://github.com/Hassan-Merai/).

It is a machine learning pipeline designed and deployed on AWS, using an EC2 t3.large instance and an S3 bucket for storage.

The EC2 instance was responsible for executing all processing steps, including:

# Project Modules Overview

1. `module_1_data_cleaning.ipynb` — Clean raw CSV data  
2. `module_2_feature_engineering.ipynb` — Create new features from cleaned data  
4. `module_3_preprocessing.ipynb` — Prepare dataset for modeling (scaling, encoding, etc.)  
5. `module_4_model_training.ipynb` — Train machine learning models and save results  
6. `module_5_frontend.ipynb` — Streamlit app for visualizing results
7. `module_6_icd9_cm.ipynb` — ICD9-CM Catalogue for transaltion of the ICD-Codes in the Dataset (could be a feature in the Front End)


The main goal of the project was to build a model capable of identifying potential health insurance fraud in the United States, particularly fraud committed by healthcare providers.

The entire project was implemented in Python, primarily using Dask and Pandas for data handling.
We used XGBoost as the main machine learning algorithm and Apache Airflow for workflow automation.

# Insights 
We used SHAP to analyse the influence of the variables on the target variable. The most important variables for determining fraudulent behaviour are all variables that are directly related to money and budgets.

In summary, a key indicator is how much of the budget per patient is spent by the provider. If it is on average, this lowers the probability of fraudulent behaviour. If it deviates strongly from the mean, this increases the probability of fraudulent behaviour.
## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Built to mimic **real-world enterprise workflows**  
✅ Touches **all stages of the ML lifecycle**  
✅ Shows hands-on skills in **modern MLOps**  
✅ Cloud-ready and production-grade  
✅ **Team project** with clearly documented components

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Add real-time fraud streaming with Apache Kafka  
- Integrate ICD-10 for medical condition mapping  
- Deploy to AWS SageMaker or GCP Vertex AI  
- Add monitoring with Prometheus + Grafana

## 👥 Team
Built collaboratively by two data scientists over in a remote Agile setting, with GitHub and VS Code for collaboration and EC2 for shared compute.
